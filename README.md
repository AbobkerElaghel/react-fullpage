TODO

- write README.md documenting state changes via the render prop and how it hooks into fullpage.js events API
- document props as options to fullpage.js
- tests
- remove jquery implementation/dependency when fullpage.js v3 is ready
- write license or link to fullpage.js license
- write Contributing.md or link to fullpage.js Contributing.md
- write guide on how-to test or link to fullpage.js how to test (or both as fullpage.js wiki does not have testing guidelines atm)
- link to `examples/` section in readme and ask for guideance
- make a react-fullpage.js gh-pages site that either uses the same markup ups fullpgae.js or another agreed upon layout (should be simple as this repo is a wrapper around markup and events)
